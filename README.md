# restaurant_program
Restaurant program made in the Test Automation course in the software tester education at Frans Schartaus Business Institute

This is a restaurant program where the user can book a table, see the food menu, leave a review and show the booking
I added some more code to make changes to the booking like change time, number of people and cancel booking
